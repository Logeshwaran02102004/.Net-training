THE BENIFITS OF THE AGILE

     improved the quality
     faster to delivered in the market , working software in the shorter iterations called sprints, quick deployment, and good features 
     increased the customer satisfactions 
     improved team collaborations
TOOLS IN AGILE
     xp, Kanban, scrum .....scrum is used for developing and Kanban is for supporting
XP (extreme programming)
     it is a framework enable team to create high quality software and high quality of life.
KANBAN
     this method is widely used to design manager improve the flow of the system we can this as a pull system or also visual system which means the work everything can be seen by everyone which next who need to the task and current status of the work everything can be easily identity here
LEAD 
     this is used to identity the waste and increase the speed of the process and development waste is said to like the waiting time or moving from one place t another etc...
SCRUM FRAMEWORK
     scrum is framework, using this framework we can achieve the goal of the end product introduced in 1990 and published in 1995 so it is a lite weight framework which is in cell format team will work to achieve a commom goal and to reach the end product it can be used in anywhere like in any domain according to the survey in 2021 it shows 66 % of the project is running through the scrum. 6 percent they are the Kanban and even hybrid combain scrum and Kanban called scrubbing. so we are calling the agile as mindset

DAY 1

GIT OPEN SOURCE VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM TOOL svn, mercurial etc.
used to work with offline
GIT HUB
     it is cloud based where we can store then we share and work with others            also its platform for integrating .
it is used by online
     its actual a company founded in 2008.
ALTERNATE TO GITHUB
     GitLab. gitbucket, host our own
INITIALIZE THE GIT - local repository
     create the file, folders etcc
     add the files to the staging environment
     commit the files
     push the files       ---remote repository
PULL THE FILES

VARIOUS TYPES OF LANGUAGE
1. assembly language : low level language intended to communicate directly with the hardware
2.assembler : is a program that translates commands into machine code .they gather instructions components :
               1.syntex : basic structure
               2.lale : a word, a symbol, which can be used as a reference point to locate instructions
               3. command : an order
               4. operand : data manipulation
               5. directive : instructions to change or perform action
               6. macro : shortcut representation
               7. mnemonics : represents abbreviations of the actions performed
eg : MOV a, 10 --registers 10 in a location a
     MOV 5, b
     ADD a,b,c --adds awith band stores in c
3.Machine language : every character in he keyboard will have an ascii number and it always occupies 1 byte (8buts, either '0' or a '1')
00000000 - stop the program
00000001 - switch on

4. Programming language :
        a) procedural language : a sequence of instructions in an order
          c, c++, java, basic, parcal
        b) Function programming lang : more focus on the output ofa mathematical calculation/evaluation
          scala, erlang, python, f#, elixir
        c) oop lang : treats a program as a group of objects composed of data and program elements (attributes, and methods)
          c++, java, c#, python, ruby
        d) scripting lang : automates repetative tasks, manages the dynamic content
         php, java script, Perl, python, bash, node js
        e) logic programming lang : instead of passing instructions as what to do, we express a series of facts and rules that will be interpreted by the system and gives out the decisions
        prolong, data long, aima, abyss
       f) frontend : mostly used for supporting UI/Ux (user Interface/user experience), images, colors, text, navigation
       html, JavaScript, react js, angular
       g) back end : deals with the storage and manipulations of data(server side software).no direct interaction with the user
       JavaScript, php, java, c#

DOTNET FRAMEWORK
    - it is a software component that predominantly runs in the windows operating systems(tools and libraries)
    - it platform independence also languages independence
    - is a plat


ASSEMBLIES
     - any .NET applications on compilation gives assembly files(.dll or .exe)
     - assemblies are the fundamental unit if the deployment, version control, reuse and security for a .NET application
     - contains PE header(portable header), CLR header, IL and manifest files
     - Manifest files contain metadata
     -Assemblies can be private or shared
     -shared assembly are placed in GAC (global assembly cache)
     -we use ILDASM to peek into assembly file we can also export to a text file
     -we use ILASM to reconstruct an assembly from the text file


are the project resources that contain the IL,
they are two types (.exe or .dll) it can be anyone in the .dot net framework



CSHARP :
Names space : a logical way to organize our program
              - it is a collection of classes, interface, events, delegates, structures, enums and also other namespace - collection of classes
 

DAY 2

DOT NET APLLICATION

boxing, unboxing, explicit type, implicit type conversations, reference type
if else, switch case,
operators-
for each and looping

PARAM :

static and non static function



value type stored in heap
reference type stored in stack 

static methods runs automatically when a class is created

converting value type to object type is called boxing

a clean definition about abstraction inheritance interface method why we using multiple inheritance and multilevel inheritance day 5 and day 6 all recap
 

interface is used achieve the multiple inheritance

abstract class can have abstract method and non abstract method

abstract method you need to use override keyword the should be given the derived class
need to learn about the sealed function


polymorphism

inherits
interface only executes the methods -> doubt

 

data abstraction
polymorphyism
function overloading function over riding

virtual method does not need a compulsory definition but abstract method must need definition


functions are divided into to two types call by value and call by reference
index overloading and object overloading
this keyword
override to string
need to learn equals method not equal and inbuild function .equals
exceptions


collections

two types ; generic and non generic collection

arraylist list

hash table keys can be given by us
** **

stack  day 8,day11
icomparer same information and to check the multiple conditions
icomparable we can do only one method in the class
delegate  without return with argument

action delegate
 
file handling
what is resource management in C#

shallow copy ...when we create object at the same time we will bw creating the new address once we declare the address it will print or else if we create a second object in that we change the address means it will update the current given address to first object also

in deep copy obj1 and obj2 or multiple everything will be independent

c# serialization

partial class and method
threading and mutiyjreading


Day 13

nullable type is identify by symbol ?
Global namespace qualifier
     for calling the function without the namesspace we can go with the global keyword
Inline warning
auto property initializer
dictionary initializer
continual null

=================================================================================================================================


STATIC AND NO STATIC FUNCTION

A static function belongs to the class itself, not to any particular object.
You can call it directly using the class name, without creating an instance,
it runs automatically when a class is created.

A non-static function (or instance method) belongs to an object of a class.
You must create an object before calling it.

BOXING AND UNBOXING

Converts a Value Type into an Object (Reference Type).
The value type gets stored in the heap, wrapped (“boxed”) inside an object.

Extracts the Value Type from the Object (Reference Type) back to a Value Type.
The value is copied from heap to stack.

OOPS CONCEPTS ABSTRACTION

Abstraction means showing only the essential features of an object while hiding unnecessary details.
It helps you focus on what an object does, not how it does it.

ENCAPSULATION

Encapsulation means binding data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit — a class.
It also means restricting direct access to the internal data of a class to protect it from unintended modification.
It also means restricting direct access to the internal data of a class to protect it from unintended modification.

INHERITANCE

Inheritance is the process where one class (child/derived class) can reuse and extend the features (fields and methods) of another class (parent/base class).

: is used to inherit the parent class

POLYMORPHISM

it allows the same method name to behave differently based on the object or context that is calling it.
Compile-time (Static)	Method Overloading	Same method name, different parameters
Runtime (Dynamic)	Method Overriding	Same method name in parent and child class
=====================================================================================================================================







calling the procedure by the execute--it is execute when only we call it
calling the function using the select--it is execute when only we call it
triggers of the sql
defenitions
---triggers executed automatically
---cascade changes through related tables
     1. if any changes happens in the first table it automatically update the second table
---Enforce more complex data integrity
     2.


TRANSACTIONS
----it is a group of sql statements execute in a single logic unit	--ensuring that both are are passed or both are failed and there will be no partial....

DIRTY READ
----it will read the uncommitted datas (which is we have written a code but not yet committed )
NON REPEATABLE READ
----A Non-Repeatable Read happens when a transaction reads the same row twice and gets different values because another transaction modified (and committed) the row in between.
ISOLATIONS
READ UNCOMITTED
----Transactions can read data that other transactions have modified but not committed.
----T1 updates a balance but doesn’t commit.
T2 can still see the updated value.
If T1 rolls back, T2 saw wrong data → dirty read.
Example:
T1 reads balance = 1000
T2 changes it to 500 and commits
T1 reads again → gets 500 → non-repeatable read


READ COMMITTED
-----A transaction can only read committed data.
But if you read the same row twice and another transaction commits a change between the reads, you get different results.
-----T1 reads balance = 1000
T2 changes it to 500 and commits
T1 reads again → gets 500 → non-repeatable read

REPEATABLE READ
----Once a transaction reads a row, no other transaction can modify it until the first finishes.
But new rows that match the search condition can still appear → phantom read.

SERIALIZABLE (Highest Isolation)
----Transactions behave as if executed one after another, not at the same time.
It provides full isolation but can reduce performance due to locking.
EXAMPLE==== when t1(transaction) is executing and t2 is trying to insert something ath that time...... Database blocks T2 because it could cause a phantom for T1.then it can continue



ADO.NET (activates data object)
---it is a set of framework classes which allows to interact with the database
CONNETED ARCHETECTURE
Executenonquery ==returns integer value
sql data reader=cmdexecutereader()
xml data reader=cmd.executexmlreader()
object ob = cmd.executescaler()


PROCEDURES---with parameters
TRANSACTION
--sql transaction because it have methods called rollback and commit
-- check all the queries the same database


DISCONNECTED ARCHIETECTURE
all crud operation can performed in offline

1.sql connection
2.sqldata adapter--holds the sql commands and connection objects for reading and writing the data you initialize it with a sql select statement and connection object==its having an update method to update the database(offline changes)
3.dataset--this a class makes the application in offline and it is a class

LINQ--language integrated query
--link follows common programing model irrespective data source application uses
--
================================================================================================================================
ADO.NET ENTITY FRAMEWORK--alternate way to interact with the database
DRAWBACK OD ADO.NET
--SIMPLE PIECE OF INTERACTION REQUIRES A LENGTHLY CODE(10-12 lines code)
--does not supports intellisence for columns and tables(ds.tables["employee"].rows[0][0])
--you have to know the index of every columns then only the above code will works
--user has manually manage the connections and commands(like con.open , con.close etcc)
--"integrated security = true; databse:"name of database";server"here server name"
(sql command smd= new sqlcommand (selct * from employees))
--it is not typesafe
example (dy.rows add("null","logesh",3000,"1-1-2020",10))// here the errors are check at runtime
--difficult to master(coz to may classes)
ENTITY FRAMEWORK
--3-4lines of code(coz of linq queries)
--supports intellisence
--no need pf manage connection
--no need to write commands
--most 0f the things are done automatically(only thing you need to do is u need to run the tool)
--instead of sql queries you need to use linq queries
var res = from t in tablename
          where t.is>2
          select t;
--it checks at compile time itself
--1 class does all the operations

WHAT IS ENTITY FRAMEWORK
--ENTITY(RDBMS)=>TABLES
framework => it is a class and methods
--its a set class and methods which is used to work with the tables
WHAT IS ENTITY FRAME WORK
--its an orm tool
o=>object (frontend structure)
r=>relation (backend structure)
m=>mapper

0 : object # represents c# classes and properties
example : object creating for the get and set
r=>relation (backend structure of the table like primary key or foreign key )
example..creating the table
m=>mapper
entity framework will convert
empdet ob = new empdet(){empid=12,emponame="Logesh",age=20}

WHAT IS THE FILE CONTAINS
--frontend contains C# backend contains SQL

THE FILE IS MADE UP OF THREE PARTS
1.SSDL(Storage schema definition language)=>the backend structure (sql)
2.CSDL(Conceptiual schema definition language)=> The frontend structure(C#)
3.MSL(Mapping schema language)

IN ENTITY FRAMEWORK IF WE NEED TO PRINT A FORIGN KEY TABLE ALSO MEANS WE NO NEED TO GIVE JOINS OR WE DONT NEED TO
CREATE ANOTHER QUERY LINQ WE CAN DISPLAY DIRECTLY COZ ENTITY CREATE A SPEACIAL PROPERTIES FOR FORIGN KEYS

THREE APPRAOCHS TO WORK WITH THE ENTITY FRAMEWORK ARE
--DATABASE FIRST=>first yo create database + and then you write the c# programs-->it is for small and medium projects
==drawback of db first 0-------------
==by chance if the table is created wrongly then all the link quriesx
--CODE FIRST=>(more flexible than database first approach)
--MODEL FIRST
====>three steps to create a table without savechanges
step 1 : Enable Migrations
step 2 : Add-Migration (migration name)
srep 3 : Update Database

MODEL First APPRAOCH
--It is similar to code first approach
--no table exist/not database exist in backend
--class and properties will generated using design tool
--most of the things are automated
=====
--will create the databse by name mypizzaadb===table=>pizzas, name, description, price, type

WEB TERMINOLOGY
1.WEB CLIENT-->(user agent)=> a tool which is used to access the webpages
example..browser(edge,chrome,ie,mozilla,safari,netscape)

2.WEB SERVER : a piece of software which will handle all the user request
example..iis express(microsoft), apache(java),oracle server (oracle), kestrel web server(microsoft)
what is the job of web server
-------1.TO HOST WEBPAGES : MAKING THE PAGE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE
-------EVEN OTHER SUSTEM CAN ALSO ACCES THE HTML PAGES
-------PROCESS SERVER SIDE CODES :
-------TO CREATE THE DOMAIN NAMES LIKe http://localhost/infinite/home.htmletc...
http:protocol
.com(commercial)business uses
.in : Indian sites
.au : Australian sites
.org : ngo uses this
.gov : government uses this
--- to configure caching and authentication : who can use web sites
3.HTTP PROTOCOL
4.SMTP PROTOCOL
5.DOMAIN NAMES
6.CLIENT SIDE SND SERVER SIDE LANGUAGE

ASP.NET
--A web development platform, which provides programming model, comprehensive software infrastructure, and various required to build robust web applications for PCs as well as mobiles
--other web development tools in the market
-PHP
-CGI
-PERL
-RUBY ON RAIL
-JAVA ETC...

-was introduced along with .net framework 1.1 in the 2002
-web application are always hosted onto a webserver viz
--NODE
--APACHE
--ITS
--NGINX
--LITESPEED

-provide cross platform support
-is a client server architecture (browsers, web application)

WEB FORM : A form / web page has
1.code behind file : has an extension of aspx.cs and contains the code the developer
2.designer file : auto generated


WEB PAGE
when a request is received , an instance of the required of the requested page/form is created
--events are processed
--generates html and posts to the client
--the page is destroyed immediately

LIFE CYCLE OD A PAGE
S- starts the page
i-initialization(all control class)
l-load
v-validate
e-event handling
r-render (css,html,ui)

NOTE:  All web servers are basically instances of ASP.net web page class has the following very useful properties that
=====================================================
STATE MANAGEMENT
CAN BE ACHIEVE USING THE BELOW TECHNIQUES
1.client side
**A) view state:**is a simple dictionary object that stores data as key value pairs------stores in form collection
does not need any type casting
can store any data including UDT's
stores the data at the client side
can retain the state across multiple postbacks of the same page
cannot travel to other pages

b) hiddenfields : is a control in the toolbox , which will not be visible at runtime
is a class that needs to be initialized along with its members , which can be a load on the systems
like viewstate this also cam retain the state across multiple postback of the same page 
cannot travel to othe page 
can be used if minimal data needs to be stored

c) COOKIES
Allows managing the state across pages can travel to other pages can travel to other pages with the previous state they are two types
1 persistence cookies (uses an object HTTP Cookies class to store data)
non-persistence (data is stored directly in the response object)

D) QUERY STRINGS
allows to manage 

Server side 
session side-->one session to another session while redirecting it will count(view state will not allow the values from one session to another session but session side will to that).....
application state-->used to check how many times the website is opened
